# SSL Library Analysis for Windows 98 Port

## Open Watcom C Standard Support ‚úÖ

**Test Results:**
- **C99 Support**: YES - Open Watcom includes `stdint.h` and C99 integer types
- **stdint.h Available**: `uint8_t`, `uint16_t`, `uint32_t`, etc. all supported
- **Headers Reference C99**: Multiple headers check `__STDC_VERSION__ >= 199901L`

**Compatibility Verdict**: Open Watcom has good C99 support, expanding our library options significantly.

## SSL Library Candidates

### 1. BearSSL ‚≠ê **RECOMMENDED**

**Pros:**
- "No dynamic allocation whatsoever" - extremely portable
- Minimal dependencies: only requires `memcpy`, `memmove`, `memcmp`, `strlen`
- Small footprint: ~20KB compiled code + 25KB RAM
- State-machine API reduces runtime complexity
- Supports static linking model
- No mandatory OS-specific system calls

**Cons:**
- Constant-time crypto may stress older hardware
- Modern TLS protocols (1.0-1.2) vs Win98 expectations
- Requires careful porting for crypto performance

**Win98 Compatibility**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (4/5) - Very promising with some optimization needed

### 2. Mbed TLS (formerly PolarSSL) ‚ùå

**Pros:**
- Well-established library
- Modular design
- Extensive platform support

**Cons:**
- **Requires C99 toolchain explicitly**
- Complex build system (CMake, Python dependencies)
- Heavyweight for Win98 constraints
- Modern development practices assume newer environments

**Win98 Compatibility**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê (2/5) - Possible but requires major adaptation

### 3. Historical OpenSSL Versions üîç

**Research Needed:**
- OpenSSL 0.9.8 era (2005-2015) might have Win98 support
- Likely has period-appropriate crypto standards
- May have simpler build requirements

**Next Steps**: Investigate OpenSSL 0.9.8 specifically for Win98 compatibility

### 4. Custom Minimal SSL Implementation üõ†Ô∏è

**Pros:**
- Complete control over Win98 optimization
- Only implement needed protocols (SSL 3.0/TLS 1.0)
- Can use Win98-era crypto standards
- Minimal footprint by design

**Cons:**
- Significant development effort
- Security review challenges
- Limited protocol support

## Windows 98 Constraints to Consider

**Memory Limitations:**
- 32MB typical system memory
- 16-bit application compatibility expectations
- Limited virtual memory management

**Crypto Performance:**
- Pentium-era processors (no AES-NI)
- Software-only cryptography
- RSA/DH operations will be slow

**Network Stack:**
- Winsock 1.1/2.0 available
- Limited TLS protocol support in OS
- Certificate store management differences

## Recommendation: Start with BearSSL

**Rationale:**
1. **Minimal dependencies** align with Win98 constraints
2. **No dynamic allocation** = predictable memory usage
3. **Small footprint** fits Win98 memory limitations  
4. **Portable design** reduces porting complexity

**Proposed Approach:**
1. Download and examine BearSSL source structure
2. Create minimal test implementation 
3. Focus on SSL 3.0/TLS 1.0 support initially
4. Optimize crypto operations for Pentium-era CPUs

**Estimated Effort:**
- Initial port: 2-3 weeks
- Optimization: 1-2 weeks  
- Testing/validation: 1 week

## Next Steps

1. Download BearSSL source code
2. Analyze build system and dependencies
3. Create minimal Win98 test implementation
4. Document any additional Open Watcom compatibility issues
